kubectl config set-cluster cluster.local --server=http://127.0.0.1 --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true

single node cluster working with private 127.0.0.1 bind adresses to http port 8080 api server link
move to secure ports and protocols next

kube-proxy kubeconfig is not being used systemd service file points it to 127.0.0.1

implement the health checks for core manifests some were causing the pod to fail with apiserver being one of those

still need to look into etcd-events pod manifest
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cluster/saltbase/salt/etcd/etcd.manifest

host level log file mounts for core services manifests??
  commented them out because they were breaking pod deployment
  is docker logs insufficient?

weave issues (had to first set priveleged containers=true in kubelet and apiserver)
