generating certs will have to be done for each environmen or cluster as IPs are in cert request

openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca.key -subj "/CN=127.0.0.1" -days 10000 -out ca.crt
openssl genrsa -out apiserver.key 2048
openssl x509 -req -in apiserver.key -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out apiserver.crt -days 10000 -extensions v3_ext -extfile csr.conf
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout sa.key -x509 -days 10000 -out sa.pub

openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout apiserver-kubelet-client.key -x509 -days 10000 -out apiserver-kubelet-client.crt

kubelet client cert generation
    ca.crt from master needs to go to node
    openssl x509 -req -in node1.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out node1.crt -days 10000
    node1 is still in notReady state and I think it has to do with api server not trusting this cert and kubelet 10250 port with host IP maybe cert needs specific host IP

To Access Dashboard
kubectl -n kube-system edit service kubernetes-dashboard
    change ClusterIp to node port
kubectl get all --all-namespaces
    note port of kube-dashboard and then get vagrant VM ip and call
